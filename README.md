# Interdisciplinary Project

This project is about homophily in the labor market. More precisely, ethnicity and race related features are used to analyze the labor market. The data is taken from IPUMS CPS (Current population survey), which provides data that can be used for analyzing social and economic trends in the U.S. (https://cps.ipums.org/cps/about.shtml)


## Interesting Research Questions
### Diversity of jobs
- Are there jobs that are dominated by a race / more diverse?
- Did jobs become more diverse in the past years (not that much grouping anymore)?
- Can job transitions from not so diverse job categories to more diverse ones be observed? (Is there a trend to become more diverse? Is there a specific timespan when this started/ was most intense?)

### How people choose jobs
- Which generation is more likely to select more diverse jobs?
- Does the reason why someone moved to the U.S. have an influence on the occupation they choose?
- Are people that are born in a multicultural family (mother and father are born in different countries) more likely to work in more diverse jobs (NATIVITY, Mother's Birthplace, Father's Birthplace)?
- Are people that have a spouse with a different nationality than theirs more likely to work in more diverse jobs?

### Income
- Is there a different income between different races/immigration time?

### Network
- What links between race and occupation can be observed over several years?
- occupation mobility network for white, black, hispanic, ... per year -> visualize
