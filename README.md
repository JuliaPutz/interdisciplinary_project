# Interdisciplinary Project

This project is about homophily in the labor market. More precisely, ethnicity and race related features are used to analyze the labor market. The data is taken from IPUMS CPS (Current population survey), which provides data that can be used for analyzing social and economic trends in the U.S. (https://cps.ipums.org/cps/about.shtml)
